## Key pins
---
|Key Pins   	|Description   	|Notes   	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
|A9   	|TX1   	|Connect to RX on the Serial port connector   	|
|A10   	|RX1   	|Connect to TX on the Serial port connector   	|
|B6   	|SCL1   	|OLED display   	|
|B7   	|SDA1   	|OLED display   	|

## Uploading code 
---
If the code fails to upload, the error is usually one of the following: 
1. The platformio.ini is missing the `upload_protocol = serial` and `upload_port = COMX` settings.
2. RX / TX pins have been mixed up from the STM to the serial port connector. They should go to the opposite pins on the serial port connector. 
3. The jumper is not in the correct position. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-jey/robotsummer/master/images/blue-pill.jpg)
