Mechanical aspects
Chassis
PL2 W7K's chassis was constructed primarily out of lasercut hardboard. The chassis was designed in a modular fashion, separating the robot into sections containing the main functional zone, the electrical compartment, and an external drivetrain mounted underneath

Drivetrain
PL2 W7K consisted of an external/removable drivetrain subassembly, consisting of two independent barbercoleman DC motors and a 1:3 motor-to-wheel gear ratio to provide a strong balance between torque and speed

Claws
Mirrored side claws were implemented to enable rapid deployment and simple functionality. Constructed from waterjet sheetmetal, the outstretched arms allowed PL2 to grab and rescue ewoks without ever stopping

Bridge deployment
Gaps in the course were tackled with a forklift-style bridge deployment mechanism. Front arms were lasercut from acrylic plastic to allow fast and controlled bridge laying

Basket mechanism
A removable basket was also lasercut from hardboard. A metal hook was added with bearings to ensure the basket could easily slide down the zipline on the course. The basket was deployed using a platform and pulley system, powered by a continuous servo
