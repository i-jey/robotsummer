## Chassis

PL2 W7K's chassis was constructed primarily out of lasercut hardboard. The chassis was designed in a modular fashion, separating the robot into sections containing the main functional zone, the electrical compartment, and an external drivetrain mounted underneath

## Drivetrain

PL2 W7K consisted of an external/removable drivetrain subassembly, consisting of two independent barbercoleman DC motors and a 1:3 motor-to-wheel gear ratio to provide a strong balance between torque and speed

## Claws

Mirrored side claws were implemented to enable rapid deployment and simple functionality. Constructed from waterjet sheetmetal, the outstretched arms allowed PL2 to grab and rescue ewoks without ever stopping

## Bridge deployment

Gaps in the course were tackled with a forklift-style bridge deployment mechanism. Front arms were lasercut from acrylic plastic to allow fast and controlled bridge laying

## Basket mechanism

A removable basket was also lasercut from hardboard. A metal hook was added with bearings to ensure the basket could easily slide down the zipline on the course. The basket was deployed using a platform and pulley system, powered by a continuous servo
