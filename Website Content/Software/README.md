Code structure, decisions, weird STM32 stuff etc.

The brain of PL2 W7K was the STM32 "Blue Pill" microcontroller. The small size, fast clock speeds, and large pinout arrays made the blue pill the top choice for a compact robot. A C++ framework enabled object-oriented Arduino-style code, allowing for modular and easily-integratable components and sequences.
