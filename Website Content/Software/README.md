Code structure, decisions, weird STM32 stuff etc.
=== 

The brain of PL2 W7K was the STM32 "Blue Pill" microcontroller. The small size, fast clock speeds, and large pinout arrays made the blue pill the top choice for a compact robot. A C++ framework enabled object-oriented Arduino-style code, allowing for modular and easily-integratable components and sequences.

## Menu/control system

A multi-menu control panel was implemented on to the side of PL2 to allow for on-the-spot value adjustment and testing.
